# Formal

Form is a next-generation form libraries for [Angular](https://angular.dev/). It is designed to be an alternative to Angular's `ReactiveFormsModule` which uses modern API and improves on DX.

This library is currently in alpha stage, and is not ready and well tested for all use cases. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

This implementation is based on proposal in https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51786.
